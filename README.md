# 50 PROJECTS IN 50 DAYS | HTML, CSS & JS
Here is the third project of my 50in50 series, based on a Udemy course by Brad Traversy.   
  
  
### __The task is to build simple, aesthetic interfaces and widgets using only* HTML, CSS & JS.__  

  
For some of these, I just follow the tutorial exactly as it is, focused on sharpening those core concepts;  
but on occasions, I take the tutorial as a starting point, and from there on I work on making it my own - playing with different styles, adding details, sometimes even using extra tools (e.g. LESS or SASS).

Either way, **my goal is always to have fun creating beautiful things** and expanding my toolkit, one line of code at a time.

*I had bought Brad's course a while ago, when I was starting my journey in web development; however, as many of us do, I bought it along with several others, and I left it behind while working my way through a more extensive one. Then, I got into a coding bootcamp, learnt React, and never worked with pure CSS and JS again since.*  

*But recently, I've been reconnecting with my passion for frontend development and design, and understanding, more than ever, the importance of mastering the basics. So I decided to pick CSS and vanilla JS back up, starting the course over from scratch. And let me tell you, I am having lots of fun creating these projects; the process is short and simple, and I'm finding it's a great way to dust off many essential concepts that were getting rusty in the back of my mind.*  

*I'm actually looking forward to creating another one tomorrow.*  
*Stay tuned!*
